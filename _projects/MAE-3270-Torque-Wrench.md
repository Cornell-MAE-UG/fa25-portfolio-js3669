For the final project for MAE 3270 (Mechanics of Materials), I designed and analyzed a torque wrench rated for a torque of 600 lb-in around given constraints. Given the desired factor of safety for three different failure modes (yield, fracture, and fatigue), I selected a material and dimensions that would satisfy these requirements. I wrote a MATLAB script to calculate these safety factors and then validated the hand calculations using ANSYS. The project also includes a discussion of strain gauges and how the design satisfies a minimum strain gauge output requirement.
