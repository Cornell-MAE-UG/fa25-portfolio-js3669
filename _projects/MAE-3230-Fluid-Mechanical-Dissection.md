The final project for MAE 3230 (Introductory Fluid Mechanics) was a Fluid Mechanical Dissection of a device that utilizes the principles of fluid mechanics, and a 5 minute video documenting our work. My group was assigned a chainsaw, and our video showcases the function of all the components with a specific focus on the carburetor. To quantify properties of the system, we attempted to calculate the air-to-fuel ratio as well as the Reynold’s number using dimensions we directly measured. My specific role was assisting with the math and identifying any assumptions present in our calculations.
