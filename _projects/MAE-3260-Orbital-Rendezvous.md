For the final group project for MAE 3260 (System Dynamics), my group decided to model the control system of an orbital rendezvous. Using the Clohessy-Wiltshire equations, we developed a simplified model of two spacecraft in coplanar orbits. We implemented a PD controller to achieve the docking of the two satellites. The full write up of the project (linked below) includes assumptions, design parameters, practical considerations, the full MATLAB code, and an animation of the system.
