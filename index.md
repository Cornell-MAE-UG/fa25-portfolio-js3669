## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/Juhi Singh DBF Headshot.JPG" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Juhi Singh and I am a junior at Cornell University studying Mechanical Engineering. I am passionate about aerospace and structural engineering and constantly seek opportunities that expand my knowledge. 

I am a part of Cornell Design Build Fly, an undergraduate student project team that creates a custom radio-controlled aircraft for the annual AIAA competition. I currently serve as the lead of the Aerodynamics, Stability and Controls Subteam, where I oversee the design, analysis, testing, and manufacturing of all aerodynamic subsystems. 

Over the past two summers, I’ve completed internships in solar structure design, working on projects that ranged from deployable lunar solar arrays to rooftop mounting structures. My internships have provided a practical context in which I can apply my technical knowledge, especially when designing components that integrate into larger systems. 

Overall, my experiences have prepared me to thrive in fast-paced environments, and tackle complex challenges both in a team and independently.
