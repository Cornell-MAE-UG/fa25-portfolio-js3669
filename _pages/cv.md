#### Work Experience
- **Folditure - Mechanical Engineering Intern**    
  Hoboken NJ, May 2025 - July 2025    
  - Worked on an origami-based, re-deployable 50 kW Lunar Solar Array as part of a NASA Phase II SBIR grant
  - Prototyped a novel folding geometry using CNC-machined aluminum sheets riveted to hinges, determined assembly order, and assisted with troubleshooting and design improvements
  - Designed and assembled mock-up solar panel sections and tested deployment of folding mechanisms
  - Designed 3D-printed solutions using SolidWorks to facilitate prototyping and testing, including a dual-axis tracker mount and assorted custom hinges
  - Researched and optimized material choices such as carbon fiber and MLI to minimize weight
  - Minimized cable weight by 72% by optimizing solar cell wiring configurations (series/parallel)
- **Atria Power Corporation - Structural Engineering Intern**  
  Bangalore, India, May 2024 - Aug 2024  
  - Modeled, analyzed, and designed sloped mounting structures for residential rooftop solar installations using STAAD (Structural Analysis and Design software) to withstand wind speeds up to 150 kmph
  - Calculated and simulated wind loads in accordance with the Indian government code of practice and analyzed based on factor of safety and displacement constraints
  - Improved design to increase factor of safety by 67%, factoring in cost, usability, and site requirements
  - Used AutoCAD to model the designs and make 2D drawings to send to manufacturers
